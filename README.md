*"Last Friday night and Saturday morning, we were attempting to do a storage migration overnight. Matt was not expecting to be on that call but when we got stuck, we desperately reached out for help and he responded within minutes. There was no attitude of "But it's Friday night!" or "It's not my shift or my problem". He just got to work and played an instrumental part in making it successful despite challenges along the way. Matt was able to wake up from a deep sleep and come up with the solution to why we were stuck for the past several months. Thanks for jumping on that call with us at the last minute and for your contributions to overcome the obstacles we faced. It's great to have you on our team when needed!"*

It will take me a bit to digest this. This is so great. Thanks Matt."*
